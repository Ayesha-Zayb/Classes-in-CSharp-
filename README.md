# Classes in C# – Complete Project

## Introduction
Classes are the core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#. A class acts as a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It helps developers organize code in a logical, reusable, and secure way.

This project explains the concept of classes in C# with clear explanations and real-world examples. The project is designed for academic submission and GitHub upload.

## What is a Class?
A class is a user-defined data type that contains:
- Data members (fields or properties)
- Member functions (methods)

Objects are created from classes using the `new` keyword.

---

## Syntax of a Class
```csharp
class ClassName
{
    // Data members
    // Methods
}
```

---

## Key Features of Classes
- Code reusability
- Data security through encapsulation
- Easy maintenance
- Real-world modeling

---

## Project Examples
This project includes three examples:
1. Student class (basic structure)
2. BankAccount class (constructor & encapsulation)
3. Car class (properties & real-world object)

Each example is placed in a separate folder for clarity.

---

## Conclusion
Classes are essential for building structured and scalable C# applications. By grouping data and behavior together, classes make programs easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. This project demonstrates the practical use of classes through simple and meaningful examples.
